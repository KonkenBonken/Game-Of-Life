# Conway's Game of Life
#### Conway's Game of Life, built in Java, using Processing

Start by painting your start frame with the mouse. Then press `s` to start.
The state of each cell will then be determined by four simple rules:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours **dies**, *as if by underpopulation.*
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours **lives** on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours **dies**, *as if by overpopulation.*
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a **live** cell, *as if by reproduction.*

Pause and play by pressing `s`.
Clear the board by pressing `r`.
